If you're receiving a "module not found" error when trying to import `websockets`, and it’s related to the Python environment being "externally managed," it means that `pip` was blocked from installing `websockets` in the global environment due to this environment management. You have a few options to install and use `websockets` without triggering this restriction.

Here’s what you can do:

### 1. **Use a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)

A virtual environment lets you install packages like `websockets` without modifying the system Python environment. This is the safest and most flexible solution.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS or Linux
   ```

3. **Install `websockets` in the Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   pip install websockets
   ```

4. **Use Python from this Environment:**

   Now you can run Python scripts and import `websockets` without any issues.

5. **Deactivate the Environment** (when finished):

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

### 2. **Install `websockets` with the `--break-system-packages` Flag**

If you want to install `websockets` globally in the current environment and override the restriction, you can use the `--break-system-packages` option:

```bash
pip install websockets --break-system-packages
```

This flag forces `pip` to install `websockets` in a managed environment. Be cautious when using this option, as it can lead to conflicts if the environment is managed by a package manager like Homebrew.

### 3. **Use `pyenv` to Manage Python Versions**

If you frequently encounter issues with an externally managed environment, consider using `pyenv` to manage multiple, isolated Python versions:

1. **Install `pyenv` via Homebrew**:

   ```bash
   brew install pyenv
   ```

2. **Install a New Python Version**:

   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.x.x  # Replace 3.x.x with the version you need
   pyenv global 3.x.x
   ```

3. **Install `websockets` in the `pyenv`-managed Python**:

   Now you can install `websockets` directly with `pip` in this version without restrictions.
