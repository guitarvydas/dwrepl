Here's how you can structure this Python code using `asyncio`. We’ll have two coroutines running forever: one for checking if a file has been modified, and another for receiving messages from a WebSocket. When either coroutine detects a trigger (file modification or a message pattern), it will call a `rerun()` function, which will generate output text and send it to the WebSocket.

Here’s the complete example code:

```python
import asyncio
import os
import websockets

async def rerun(websocket):
    """Function called by both coroutines when a trigger is detected."""
    output_text = "Rerun triggered! Generating new output..."
    print(output_text)
    
    # Send the output to the websocket
    await websocket.send(output_text)

async def watch_file(filepath, interval, websocket):
    """Checks if a file has been modified and calls rerun if it has."""
    if not os.path.exists(filepath):
        print(f"File '{filepath}' does not exist.")
        return

    # Get the initial modification time
    last_mod_time = os.path.getmtime(filepath)
    print(f"Watching file: {filepath}")

    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(interval)
        current_mod_time = os.path.getmtime(filepath)

        # Check if the file modification time has changed
        if current_mod_time != last_mod_time:
            print(f"File '{filepath}' has been modified.")
            last_mod_time = current_mod_time
            await rerun(websocket)  # Call rerun when the file is modified

async def websocket_listener(uri, pattern, filepath):
    """Listens to websocket messages and calls rerun if a pattern is detected."""
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
        # Start watching the file in the background
        asyncio.create_task(watch_file(filepath, 2, websocket))

        while True:
            # Receive message from the websocket
            message = await websocket.recv()
            print(f"Received message: {message}")

            # Check if the message contains the pattern
            if pattern in message:
                print(f"Pattern '{pattern}' detected in message.")
                await rerun(websocket)  # Call rerun if the pattern is detected

# Entry point for the asyncio program
async def main():
    uri = "ws://localhost:12345"  # Replace with the WebSocket URI you want to connect to
    filepath = "path/to/your/file.txt"  # Replace with the path to the file to watch
    pattern = "trigger"  # Replace with the pattern to search for in the messages

    await websocket_listener(uri, pattern, filepath)

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Explanation

1. **`rerun(websocket)`**: This function is called whenever either of the two coroutines detects a trigger. It generates a message and sends it to the WebSocket.

2. **`watch_file(filepath, interval, websocket)`**: This coroutine checks the file's last modification time at a given interval. If the modification time changes, it calls `rerun(websocket)`.

3. **`websocket_listener(uri, pattern, filepath)`**: This coroutine connects to a WebSocket server at `uri`. It listens for incoming messages and checks if they contain a specified pattern. If the pattern is detected, it calls `rerun(websocket)`.

4. **`main()`**: The entry point for the program. It sets up the WebSocket connection and starts the `websocket_listener`, which also initiates the `watch_file` coroutine.

5. **Concurrency**: The `asyncio.create_task(watch_file(...))` within `websocket_listener` allows the file-watching coroutine to run concurrently with the WebSocket listener, ensuring that both are active at the same time.

### Notes

- Replace `"ws://localhost:12345"` with the actual WebSocket server URI.
- Replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"` with the file path you want to monitor.
- The `pattern` variable holds the string pattern that, when detected in the WebSocket message, triggers `rerun`.
  
This code will run both tasks indefinitely, checking for file modifications and listening for WebSocket messages. When either of these triggers occurs, it calls `rerun`, which sends an output message back through the WebSocket connection.
