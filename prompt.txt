create an HTML file that displays 2 input boxes called "filename" and "input" respectively, and, displays 5 output boxes called "output", "probe A", "probe B", "probe C" and "errors", respectively, and, write a command-line python loop program that receives inputs from the input boxes whenever any input box is changed and sends strings to the output boxes

---

write a command-line node.js loop program that receives inputs from the input boxes whenever any input box is changed and sends strings to the output boxes

---

I get an error "Cannot GET /" when I open a web browser on http://localhost:3000

---

make the output boxes 5 lines long and scrollable

---------

I get an error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'websockets'" when I run "python3 server.py"

Create an HTML program that contains one textarea and creates a websocket. Every time the textarea is changed, the program sends the new contents of the textarea to the websocket as a pair of strings. The first string is the name of the textarea, the second string is the updated contents. Then, create a Python program that listens for updates from the websocket.

---

add a button to the html side called "go", when pushed it sends a pair of strings to the websocket, the first string is the id of the button and the second string is the empty string

---

to this add a readonly text area that is updated when the python server sends a pair of strings, the first string is the name of the readonly text area and the second string is the new contents of the text area

write Python code that runs 2 coroutines forever, routine 1 checks whether a file has been modified, routine 2 communicates with a websocket. Routine 1 calls "rerun" whenever the checked file has been modified, and routine 2 calls the same "rerun" whenever it notices a pattern in the incoming messages from the websocket. "Rerun" produces text output that it sends to the websocket.
